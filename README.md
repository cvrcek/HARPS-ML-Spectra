# HARPS-ML-Spectra
Repository for machine learning models developed to predict stellar parameters and simulate spectra using HARPS data. Includes code for variational and standard autoencoders, along with convolutional and residual neural networks.

**Note:** The code will be released after the acceptance of our paper.
